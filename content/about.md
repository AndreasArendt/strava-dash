# About this project
This project was based on the idea to visualize all activities for the year 2024 on a single map as a gift card for my lovely girlfriend. Since I love to look and visualize data, I hope that others share the same joy while using Atlo.
I may or may not continue working and on this project, depending on how widely it will be used. I would like to clarify that I have absolutley no intentions to store any user related data and I did this to the best of my knowledge.

Feel free to reach out to me (andi.arendt@icloud.com) in case you have any concerns, ideas or questions. I am very happy to help out in any cases.

Also consider visiting my [Github](https://github.com/AndreasArendt/Atlo) if you are interested on a code level what is behind this project.

Stay active & keep exploring!
